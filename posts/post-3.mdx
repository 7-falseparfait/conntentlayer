## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript has become the go-to choice for building scalable JavaScript applications. It adds static typing to JavaScript, which means you catch errors before your code even runs.

The most common types you'll use are:

- `string` for text
- `number` for numbers
- `boolean` for true/false values
- `array` for lists of items

## Your First TypeScript Function

Here's a simple function that adds two numbers:

```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```
